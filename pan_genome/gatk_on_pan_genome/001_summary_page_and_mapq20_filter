# Summary

## GATK for variant calling was done on the pan-genome bams, where all the reads were mapped to B73 reference genome + pan contigs.

## all the bed file windows are listed in /home/apg/qiuxx221/Widiv_pangenome/pan_gene_pav/bwa_index

## mapq filter of 20 was applied to all the picard marked bams for the variant calling 


## for mapq filters:

cd /scratch.global/qiuxx221_share/widiv_pan_bams_raw/picard_markdups/509_mapped_to_pan_genome_picard
for i in *.bam; do   echo "samtools view -bq 20 $i > /scratch.global/qiuxx221/mapq509/"$i"_MAPQ20.bam; samtools index /scratch.global/qiuxx221/mapq509/"$i"_MAPQ20.bam " ; done > samtool_mapq_20_filter_cmd.txt
