# the gff classifer was added to each g in the id conlumn, for example, all the transcript becomes Parent=no_hit_complete_hints_g9.t1 rather than g9.t1

# a final full gff3 was made via

# condensed gff3 was stored in ~/gff3/cds_hints_annotation_test/NR_checked

# all_pan_contig_annotation.gff3 is the file from all the intersect and has 126 rows still has overlap and it has been manually curated to be a set of 44110 gene models that has no overlap to each other
the list list_to_remove.txt was used to remove the duplicates. when there are overlaps, pick longer ones, when identical and even by partial or complete, picked the higher score

# the full complete gff3 is extracted using the transcript id as the anchor 
# need to add a .t to each of the contig id to extract related information
